## ML Handwritten Text Encoder
This repository reads handwritten equations and converts and solves them digitally. A sample equation that could be interpeted would consist of something like the following: "5 + 3".


## Repo Set-up
- The main.py file creates the model and the datasets for the repository. Note it is NOT neccessary to run this file as it only serves the purpose of rebuilding the datasets and the model.
